# JS_Events
JavaScript onclick HTML Events using HTML,CSS3 and JavaScript.

The onclick event in JavaScript is used to execute a certain functionality when a button or any other HTML element is clicked. It allows the programmer to trigger a JavaScript function in response to a user's click. The onclick event can be added to an element using the onclick attribute in HTML or by using the addEventListener() method in JavaScript. Here is an example of using the onclick attribute in HTML:

# HTML

<button onclick="myFunction()">Click me</button>

And here is an example of using the addEventListener() method in JavaScript:

#JavaScript
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
const button = document.querySelector("button");
button.addEventListener("click", myFunction);

When the user clicks the button in the above examples, the myFunction JavaScript function will be executed. The onclick event is not limited to buttons and can be used with various other HTML elements to handle click events

If you encounter issues with the onclick event not triggering the function, it could be due to various reasons such as incorrect function name, overlapping elements, or improper usage of the onclick attribute. It's important to ensure that the function is properly defined and that there are no overlapping elements preventing the click event from being detected.
